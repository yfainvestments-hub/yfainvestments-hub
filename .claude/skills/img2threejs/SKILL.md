# img2threejs — Image to procedural Three.js

Rebuild the object visible in a reference image as a **code-only** procedural Three.js model,
gated by a staged sculpting pipeline and an AI-vision self-correction loop. This is
reconstruction-by-code, **not** photogrammetry, mesh extraction, or downloaded art packs.

Agent-agnostic: works under Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode. Wherever this doc says "agent
vision" or "agent browser tool", use whatever the host provides — native image reading, a
browser MCP (playwright/chrome-devtools), the project preview, or a user-supplied screenshot.

## When To Use

The user attaches/points to an object image and wants a procedural Three.js model, a
reconstruction/animation/destruction plan, a sculpt spec, or code. Also for material studies,
action-ready props, game objects, botanical/mechanical parts, and stylized reconstructions.

## Core Promise

Sculpt from a photo, in order — never one-shot a mesh:
1. **Use local state first.** Initialize it once, then run
   `python3 forge/next.py --state .img2threejs/state.json [<spec>]` at every start/resume and before
   every correction iteration. Obey a hard stop; never continue from memory.
2. **Validate** the image is a suitable 3D target (`grimoire/intake/validation_rubric.md`).
3. **Assess** object class + complexity, then write a `qualityContract` before any code.
3. **Spec** it: component hierarchy, materials, lighting, pivots, sockets, action anchors.
4. **Build pass-by-pass** from blockout → structure → form → material → lighting → interaction → optimization.
5. **Verify** each pass with a screenshot compared against the reference; fail a pass if an identity-defining feature is wrong even when the global score looks fine.

State explicitly when output is approximate/stylized/low-poly. A single image cannot reveal
hidden sides or guarantee exact geometry — say so instead of faking confidence.

## Transparency and Process Debugging

Report what changed each pass with evidence (exact values/coordinates), name what still doesn't
match, and never claim "done" when only "improved". A passing gate is not proof of 3D realism.
Full rule + examples: `grimoire/review/self_correction.md`.

## Required Inputs

- one image path / screenshot / URL / attached image (if missing or unreadable, ask)
- intended use: prop, game object, hero render, playable/destructible object, animation rig
  (default: real-time browser prop with interactive performance)
- for a CS2 request, an authoritative classification record (family/subtype and evidence refs) or
  an explicit request for the user/vision provider to supply one; heuristic detection alone is not
  enough to select a geometry adapter

## Mandatory Local State Gate

Conversation context is disposable; `.img2threejs/state.json` is the local checklist authority.
Initialize it once per reconstruction:

`python3 forge/state.py init --state .img2threejs/state.json --reference <img> --profile <generic|cs2|character>`

At every fresh start, resume, or correction loop, run
`python3 forge/next.py --state .img2threejs/state.json [object-sculpt-spec.json]` before touching
code. It prints the current step, pass, incomplete mandatory steps, exact next command, and
`loop/max`. Exit code 3 or `status=stopped` is a hard stop: report the reason and request input.
Never bypass it by reconstructing progress from chat history.

After evidence exists, record it with
`python3 forge/state.py mark <step-id> --state .img2threejs/state.json --evidence <path>`.
Mark a non-applicable step `skipped` only with `--reason`; silent omission is forbidden. Loop counts
are derived from `reviewHistory` actions `refine-spec`/`refine-code`, not agent memory. Defaults are
3 corrections per pass and 6 total.

Profiles add mandatory gates rather than changing the core order: `cs2` requires classification,
manifest, and a machine-readable CS2 review before AI review; `character` requires the character
contracts and landmark evidence. Every profile records suitability, projection applicability, and
material-evidence applicability; conditional steps require evidence or an explicit skip reason.

## The Loop (scripts do enforcement; agent vision does judgment)

Run scripts from the skill root (`forge/...`). Pure Python 3.10+ stdlib, no pip installs.
Full flags: `grimoire/scripts.md`. Never let a script *score* visuals — that is the agent's job.

1. **Analyze the image first** (agent vision, before any script): work the layered observation
   protocol in `grimoire/intake/image_analysis.md` — identify/classify, decompose macro→meso→micro,
   map part relationships, name materials in PBR terms, list identity-defining features, and flag
   what the single view hides. Observation before inference; controlled 3D vocabulary; 3D
   object-space not 2D image-space. This is generic for any subject and feeds every field below.
   Then probe local images: `forge/stage1_intake/probe_image.py <image>` (metadata only, not a visual check).
1a. **Local Spec Search** — after image analysis, before writing or refining a spec, pull local
    domain evidence (anatomy/PBR/wear/geometry/runtime/physics) rather than inventing it:
    `python3 forge/stage2_spec/new_pre_spec_assessment.py "Name" --image <img> --out assessment.json`
    (auto-runs BM25, auto-picks `cs2`/`core_3d` collection, writes a `localSpecSearch` bundle that
    `new_sculpt_spec.py --assessment` carries into the spec). Full query-expansion recipe
    (bilingual terms, focused `search_specs.py` retrieval, cache rules):
    `grimoire/intake/local_spec_search.md`. MUST read it before retrying an incomplete or
    domain-specific query.
1b. **CS2 intake manifest** — for a CS2 request, create and validate `cs2-intake.json` before
    pre-spec authoring (admission, heuristic signal, classification, family/route resolution).
    MUST read `grimoire/intake/cs2_intake_contract.md` completely before creating the manifest or
    running pre-spec assessment.
2. **Pre-Spec Assessment Gate** — classify + score complexity + write the quality contract:
   `forge/stage2_spec/new_pre_spec_assessment.py "Name" --image <img> --complexity <simple|moderate|complex|ultra-complex> --out assessment.json`. Rules: `grimoire/intake/quality_contract.md`.
   Set `objectClass.primaryDomain` (`object` | `character` | `hybrid`) and fill the seeded
   `detailInventory` (its `targetMinDetails` scales with complexity). **Supported CS2 knife
   skins**: always pass `--cs2`, which defaults the complexity tier to `ultra-complex`
   (`targetMinDetails` 16, floor 9) — the finish/wear/hardware is the item, so CS2 is held to the
   top fidelity bar. Author procedural GEOMETRY but route the FINISH through the projection path in
   step 2c — a procedural finish for a patterned skin (Doppler/Gamma/Marble/Fade) reads visibly
   wrong against the reference. Finish routes + rulebook: `grimoire/build/cs2_finishes.md`;
   optional exact-texture acquisition: `grimoire/intake/cs2_texture_acquisition.md`.
2b. **Detail inventory** (do not skip for detailed subjects) — scan zones and enumerate every
   identity-defining small detail (gloss, bevel, fasteners, linework, contours, stains):
   `forge/stage1_intake/build_detail_inventory.py <image> --mode grid-3x3 --out-dir <dir> --out di.json`.
   Each detail MUST map to a `component.localFeatures` or `material.localOverrides` entry — never
   prose only. Taxonomy + 3D-term recipes: `grimoire/intake/detail_inventory.md`.
2c. **Projection-first fidelity (characters AND reference-matched surfaces — supported CS2 knife skins, decals,
   painted patterns)** — when the goal is matching a specific reference's surface, put the photo's
   own pixels on the mesh instead of approximating them procedurally. This is the single biggest
   fidelity lever; a procedural material for a patterned surface is the #1 reconstruction failure.
   Recipe (`grimoire/character/likeness_maximization.md` — its two levers, align-mesh+camera and
   project-the-photo, generalize past characters): solve the camera
   (`stage1_intake/solve_camera_pose.py` → `referenceCamera`), **de-light** the reference so it is
   free of baked lighting (`stage1_intake/delight_albedo.py`, hard requirement — this is what makes
   projection safe, not the flat-lit icon), then project the de-lit crop onto the mesh and bake it
   into UVs (`stage3_build/bake_projected_texture.py --mesh-id <id>`). For a CS2 skin the mesh is the
   procedural blade/guard/grip you author in the spec, and the projected de-lit crop IS the finish
   (front + back from the two views) — no procedural Doppler material. For characters, first capture
   landmarks (`stage1_intake/extract_landmarks.py --out anatomy.json`), fill `preSpecAssessment.anatomy`,
   route `grimoire/character/reconstruction.md`. A single view cannot show hidden sides — report
   per-region confidence and request more views when it matters.
3. Author the spec from the assessment:
   `forge/stage2_spec/new_sculpt_spec.py "Name" --image <img> --assessment assessment.json --manifest cs2-intake.json --out object-sculpt-spec.json`.
   Replace generic starter `featureReviewTargets` with the object's real identity-defining
   systems (≤5 critical, ≤3 important per pass); for characters add `anatomy-proportion`,
   `face-landmark-placement`, `pose-silhouette`, `outfit-and-palette`. Use 3D-graphics terms only
   (`grimoire/glossary/3d_vocabulary.md`), never "nice/smooth/shiny". Classify every component's
   `topologyClass`/`topologyRationale` per `grimoire/intake/surface_topology.md` before picking a
   `primitive` — this is what prevents a continuous organic form from being picked as a box.
4. When material fidelity matters and a source image exists, analyze each material's **finish** then
   extract reference PBR evidence, both per crop (crop the correct region — verify the crop is on the
   part you think it is):
   - `forge/stage1_intake/analyze_texture.py <crop> --spec spec.json --material-id <id> --in-place`
     classifies the finish (`gem-metal | gemstone | painted-metal | worn-composite | brushed-steel |
     plastic`), extracts the gradient palette, and writes doc-grounded MeshPhysicalMaterial scalars
     (metalness/roughness/clearcoat/transmission/ior/anisotropy/envMapIntensity) onto the material.
     Recipes + Three.js texture/PBR rules (colorSpace, CanvasTexture/DataTexture, height→normal) live
     in `grimoire/build/threejs_texture_reference.md`. Rule of thumb: **solid albedo for flat paint,
     real reference crop for patterned finishes** (doppler/quartz/hydro-dip/camo).
   - `forge/stage1_intake/extract_pbr_evidence.py <crop> --out-dir <dir> --material-id <id> --target-threshold 0.7`.
   Confidence < 0.7 is a stop/refine-input signal, not a pass. It is inference, not inverse rendering.
5. Validate, then strict-validate before generating code:
   `forge/stage2_spec/validate_sculpt_spec.py object-sculpt-spec.json` then `--strict-quality`.
   Strict blocks shallow specs (a complex object with one root, no repetition systems, no
   local overrides, no micro groups is NOT implementation-ready even if JSON validates).
6. **Locked build passes** — only touch the currently unlocked pass:
   `forge/stage3_build/orchestrate_passes.py status object-sculpt-spec.json`
   `forge/stage3_build/generate_threejs_factory.py object-sculpt-spec.json --out src/createObjectModel.ts`
   (generator is pass-gated: a future `--pass-id` fails until prior passes are reviewed `continue`).
   The local state adds `--force` only for a new pass or `refine-spec`; `refine-code` edits the
   current artifact without regenerating it. Before overwriting, carry valid hand refinement back
   into the spec; generated code must not be the only copy of reconstruction decisions.
7. Render the current pass in a browser/preview, capture a screenshot at a review viewpoint.
8. **Run deterministic gates before AI vision.** MUST read
   `grimoire/review/gates_reference.md` and `grimoire/review/self_correction.md` completely. Run
   `forge/stage4_review/diagnose_render.py` and record the passing Tier 1 result with
   `--spec object-sculpt-spec.json --pass-id <pass> --in-place`; for non-planar forms also run
   `forge/stage4_review/diagnose_render_multi_angle.py` with the fixed view and at least two
   meaningful orbit views. Then run
   `forge/stage3_build/orchestrate_passes.py check object-sculpt-spec.json --pass-id <pass>`.
9. Package one side-by-side sheet, then inspect it with agent vision:
   `forge/stage4_review/make_comparison_sheet.py --reference <img> --render <shot> --out cmp.png --json`.
10. Record the review (overall + per-layer + per-feature scores + decision):
    `forge/stage4_review/append_review.py object-sculpt-spec.json --pass-id <pass> --fidelity <0-1> --action <continue|refine-spec|refine-code|request-input|stop> --summary "..." --render-screenshot <shot> --comparison-image cmp.png --ai-vision-score <0-1> --layer-scores-json '{...}' --feature-reviews-json <f.json> --in-place`.
   For the CS2 knife path, also attach the versioned report with
   `--cs2-review-json cs2-review.json --review-scene-json forge/tests/fixtures/knife_review_scene.json`.
   Produce that report first with
   `forge/stage4_review/cs2_review.py --manifest cs2-intake.json --metrics cs2-review-inputs.json --scene forge/tests/fixtures/knife_review_scene.json --out cs2-review.json`.
   A failed family, painted-region, projection-coverage, critical-detail, or orbit gate blocks
   `continue` even when the global score passes. See `docs/cs2/review-gates.md`.
11. Sync pipeline state after manual review edits, record checklist evidence, then re-run the local
    state gate before another correction or pass:
    `forge/stage3_build/orchestrate_passes.py sync object-sculpt-spec.json --in-place`
    `python3 forge/next.py --state .img2threejs/state.json object-sculpt-spec.json`.
12. Before declaring completion, run
    `forge/stage4_review/check_part_coverage.py --spec object-sculpt-spec.json --manifest parts.json`
    and verify the action-ready hierarchy. Mark `part-coverage` and `action-ready` only with evidence.

## CS2 image-matched rule

For a CS2 item, the target is observable agreement between the supplied image and the rendered
item: silhouette, proportions, edge profile, hardware layout, coating colour, pattern placement,
wear, roughness response, and camera framing. Every decision must be traceable to evidence or be
labelled as an approximation.

The initial CS2 family boundary is **knife only**. Pistol, rifle, SMG, sniper, heavy, glove, and
unknown knife subtypes must stop with `unsupported-family` or `unsupported-subtype`; they must not
receive the knife component tree as a generic fallback.

For every CS2 reconstruction, MUST read the full layer contract, intake order, and surface/review
rule in `grimoire/intake/cs2_intake_contract.md` before intake state can advance.

## Gates (do not skip)

Before any visual review or `continue` decision, MUST read the full gate-by-gate contract in
`grimoire/review/gates_reference.md` (Divine Eye, VLM rescue, multi-angle, CS2 review, bounded
correction, screenshot feedback, assembly, attachment, material, detail inventory, character
track). In short:

- Validate references first (`grimoire/intake/validation_rubric.md`, `check_reference_admission.py`).
- `divine_eye.py` is deterministic-first; the VLM (`vlm_gate.py`) is a gated last layer, never
  consulted on a hard-gate failure.
- A non-planar form must hold from ≥2 angles (`diagnose_render_multi_angle.py`).
- CS2 knife builds also run `cs2_review.py` against the versioned scene fixture.
- Local state enforces 3 corrections per pass and 6 total by default; reaching either limit is a
  hard stop. `correction_loop.py` may stop earlier on repeated defects, oscillation, or plateau.
- `continue` requires a render + comparison sheet + AI-vision score ≥ threshold, every critical
  feature ≥ its own threshold (`grimoire/feedback/render_capture.md`).
- Every model ships explodable AND clickable — a structure gate, not pixels
  (`check_part_coverage.py`, `grimoire/build/geometry_patterns.md`).
- Action-ready, attachment, material/lighting, detail inventory, and character-track requirements:
  `grimoire/readiness/action_rigging.md`, `grimoire/readiness/joint_attachment.md`,
  `grimoire/feedback/shading_realism.md`, `grimoire/intake/quality_contract.md`,
  `grimoire/intake/validation_rubric.md`.

## Self-Correction

After every pass, decide exactly one: `continue | refine-spec | refine-code | request-input | stop`.
`refine-spec` fixes a wrong/missing/shallow spec (re-validate, don't patch code around it);
`refine-code` fixes geometry/material/lighting that doesn't match a sound spec. Before making the
decision, MUST read the root-cause guide + fidelity scale in `grimoire/review/self_correction.md`,
record the decision, and re-run the local state gate.

## Implementation Rules (brief)

TypeScript + plain Three.js unless the project uses a wrapper. `Group` factory
`createObjectNameModel(spec, options)`, reconstruction data kept separate from renderer objects,
deterministic seeds for all procedural noise. Prefer primitives / `Shape` extrude / curve+tube /
instancing / displacement / generated canvas textures before any external art. Full geometry &
material recipes + hard-won failure patterns: `grimoire/build/geometry_patterns.md`.

## Output

- **Analysis-only**: suitability verdict + scores, object extraction, macro→micro hierarchy,
  geometry strategy, material/lighting recipe, animation/destruction feasibility, plan + risks.
- **Implementation**: the above briefly, then edit code; verify with typecheck/build + a screenshot.
- **Not feasible**: name the blocker, ask for more views / cleaner image / accepted stylization /
  a narrower target. "This cannot reach the requested fidelity from this image" is a valid result.
